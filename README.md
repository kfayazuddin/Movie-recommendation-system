# Movie-recommendation-system
I have done this project under Microsoft Engage Program'22.

My recommendation system gives good movies recommendations to the user.In building this project, I have used #Content based similarity.

Collected dataset from #kaggle

I have used libraries :
1.)numpy
2.)pandas
3.)astral
3.)pickle

To build my web app i have done with the help of streamlit.

NOTE:After cloning above movie-recommendation-system file ,after importing pickle and dumping you will get two .pkl files i.e, movie_list.pkl and similarity.pkl.(at your saved folder location)

Copy this and where you will be using this app code paste the copied two .pkl files.

And to run the app file,use command:streamlit run filename.py, i.e streamlit run app.py

To get poster images ,i have used the tmdb link using API
